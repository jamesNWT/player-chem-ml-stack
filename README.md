# player-chem-ml-stack

This was a school projcet for my machine learning class. 

The idea was to try to model the Chemistry between teammates in professional CSGO.

The code is a bit of a mess and unorganized but for a personal project it did the job.

This project contains code that pulled data from eight thousand games from HLTV.org, and trained a neural network to try to be able to predict player performance based soley on the identities of the players in the game. In this way I hoped the model could model the "chemistry" between teammates in professional CSGO.
