Was about to give in to despair with the API not returning nearly enough info 
with the GetMatchesStats function, but found that getMatchMapStats function will
the info I need. So, I'll get a list of match ID's using the former and then get
useful information out of these matches with the former.

I still need to figure out how to get this data from a series of API calls
that return json objects to a csv...
