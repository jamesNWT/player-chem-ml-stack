Was about to give in to despair with the API not returning nearly enough info 
with the GetMatchesStats function, but found that getMatchMapStats function will
the info I need. So, I'll get a list of match ID's using the former and then get
useful information out of these matches with the former.

I still need to figure out how to get this data from a series of API calls
that return json objects to a csv...

Well, I was on my way to finishing the script but I've just gotten banned from
making IP requests to HLTV.org. I've contacted a couple people at hltv to ask
about getting whitelisted but I'm not holding out hope. I figure I can give them
a day to get back to me and in the meantime think about back-up plans.
